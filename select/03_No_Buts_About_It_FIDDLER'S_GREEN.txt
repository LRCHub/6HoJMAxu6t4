I was a fool to believe in your words
I'm hopping mad cause you lie
Jump off a cliff
Then go jump in a lake
I'll show my moon to your lies

You're a back-seat driver
Always knowing the cure
In fact you are the poison
That I cannot endure
You're simply snooty
Too big for your boots
You're a stuffed shirt
A queer bird

And I was waiting, waiting for your words
I was waiting every day
Yeah I was waiting, waiting every day
For your words to come true

I won't be waiting until I'm in a stew
You really bug me
So I'm gone - gone forever
I won't be waiting until I'm all at sea
No buts about it
I can do better without you

I really hit the roof cause you're run of the mill
You're simply crappy and you don't pay your bills, no!
You drive me crazy cause you're talk is cheap
You talked for hours I was falling asleep

So I was waiting...

Go to blazes better drop dead
You're a waste of time
You drive me mad
You pretend to be a friend
Close the door
Don't bug me anymore
